# Cyber-Security

Implementation in cybersecurity

## Random Forest

* Utilized Random Forest model to classify normal and anomaly network traffic in NSL-KDD dataset, and optimized the modelâ€™s hyperparameters through applying GridSearchCV method. Increased accuracy score from 95.31% to 99.28%.

## ARP Cache Poisoning

* Implemented ARP cache poisoning attacks in three different methods including ARP request(who-has), ARP reply(is-at), and ARP gratuitous message(destination IP and MAC addresses are Broadcast address).

## Sniff and Spoof

* Utilized network sniffing techniques to filter ICMP echo request packets(type 8) on specific network interfaces within a subnet and spoofed ICMP echo reply packets(type 0) to their source IP addresses.

* Implemented a traceroute program in Python with the ability to send ICMP packets with time-to-live field and automatically calculate the number of hops between two hosts(including DNS server).

## TCP Attack

* Developed a TCP SYN flooding attack program, with multiprocessing functionality, targeting on certain host and port and leading the network resource exhausted.

* Developed a TCP RST attack program with sequence number auto-detection for interrupting TELNET or SSH connections between client and server.

## Crypto Random Number

* Observation the entropy in random number generator in C.

## RSA

* Computed the private key in the RSA algorithm. (Given p, q, e)

* Encrypted and encrypted messages with RSA algorithm.

* Implemented digital signature with RSA algorithm.
